# Software Lifecycle

Welcome to my project! This initiative is designed to showcase the entire software development lifecycle, from code creation to deployment in Kubernetes. By embracing DevOps culture, my aim is to establish environments for continuous integration, delivery, deployment, and monitoring. This project serves as a comprehensive example of modern DevOps practices, providing hands-on experience with tools and methodologies that streamline and enhance the software development process.

# Try it out with docker-compose
